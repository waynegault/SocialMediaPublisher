# Z-Image Local Image Generation Requirements
# =============================================
# For local text-to-image generation using Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image model
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
#   - 8GB+ VRAM (16GB+ recommended for best performance)
#   - ~10GB disk space for the model
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-z-image.txt
#
# Configuration (.env):
#   IMAGE_PROVIDER=z_image
#   Z_IMAGE_STEPS=28           # 28-50, higher = better quality but slower
#   Z_IMAGE_GUIDANCE=4.0       # 3.0-5.0 CFG scale
#   Z_IMAGE_DEVICE=cuda        # or 'cpu' for testing (very slow)
#   Z_IMAGE_OFFLOAD=0          # Set to 1 for 8-12GB VRAM GPUs

# Diffusers from git (for latest ZImagePipeline support)
diffusers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers

# Core ML dependencies (may already be installed)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
transformers>=4.40.0
accelerate>=0.25.0
sentencepiece>=0.2.0

# Memory-efficient attention (optional but recommended)
# Uncomment if you have xformers compatibility issues
# xformers>=0.0.22

# Model downloading
huggingface-hub>=0.20.0

# Note: The model (~10GB) will be downloaded automatically on first use
# You can pre-download with: python setup_z_image.py download
